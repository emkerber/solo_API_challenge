Solo API Challenge

In this challenge we will be using the OMDb API to create a web page displaying your top 3 movies. You should make 3 queries to the OMDb API for each of your movies and append them to your screen. Each movie entry should use at least 3 keys from the returned data (one being the image). Your page should be styled with CSS and look presentable.

Hard Mode
Add a search input that will allow you to search for a movie and display the results in a meaningful way.
